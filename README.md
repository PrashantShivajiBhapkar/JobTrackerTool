# Job Tracker Tool

When we submit our resumes online, we just hope badly to hear back from the employer some days after applying because we know that the job matches our interests and we have a lot of passion about the job or work that the job mentions. But, most of the times it turns out that we get rejection-mails starting mostly with something like this - "We appreciate your interest in becoming a part of our team, but.....". That's not we had anticipated most of the times. The reality is your resume might not have even ended up in some recruiter's (HUMAN) hand. It actually happens as employers use tools to filter out resumes. It makes absolute sense for them to use some automated tools to tackle hundreds and thousands of resumes referred to as "Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)" which filter out resumes (you) and pass forward only those resumes that they think match with the job. This strategy sounds pretty much reasonable for employers to use.  
So what do we (APPLICANTS) do in such a situation. As a result of applying to many internship positions and getting negative replies enough number of times to motivate me to do something about it, I have come up with what I call a "Job Tracker Tool". We can call it as an equivalent of "Applicant Tracking System" for applicant. Now, I have the ability jo filter out jobs rather that getting myself filtered out by jobs (ATS). No need to blindly apply any internship/full time job position, this tools matches your resumme with many indeed job postings and gives you list of jobs that it finds most relevant to your profile. This greatly eases out job application process.
